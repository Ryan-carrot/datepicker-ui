# datepicker-ui

A simple datepicker UI component built with only HTML and CSS — based on the roadmap.sh **Datepicker UI** project.  
https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository hosts a static, non-functional datepicker UI component. It uses purely HTML and CSS (no JavaScript), and is meant to demonstrate UI structure and styling only — not actual date selection functionality.

The goal is to create a clean, accessible datepicker interface purely through markup and CSS animations/hover effects, following the “Datepicker UI” project guidelines.

## 🚀 Getting Started / Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-carrot/datepicker-ui.git
   ```
2. Open index.html (or your main HTML file) in your browser to view the static UI.
3. Customize the HTML/CSS if desired — e.g. change look and feel, colors, spacing, etc.
4. (Optional) Deploy the UI component using GitHub Pages (or any static site host) to showcase your design.

## 📄 Live Demo

You can deploy this project to GitHub Pages (or another static-site host) to share the UI publicly.

Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

## 🧰 What This Project Gives You

- A static datepicker UI design using only HTML and CSS
- Clean and semantic markup + CSS styling/animations
- A base component for UI experimentation — useful for design mockups, portfolio, or as a starting point if you later add JS functionality
- Easy to deploy and share, no build tools or dependencies required

## 📂 Example Project Structure

├── index.html # Main HTML page showing the datepicker UI
├── style.css # (optional) CSS stylesheet for styling the datepicker
├── README.md # This documentation
└── assets/ # (optional) Images, icons, etc.
└── images/

(Your actual filenames and structure may vary depending on how many assets or styles you include.)

## ✅ Notes & Considerations

- This project is a UI-only mockup — the datepicker does not actually pick dates or run any JavaScript.
- All interactions (if any) are purely visual / CSS-based (hover, focus, animations).
- Intended for portfolio, design demonstration, or to serve as a foundation if you decide to add functionality later.

## 🎯 Possible Future Enhancements

- Add JavaScript to make the datepicker functional (date selection, calendar logic)
- Enhance accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, etc.)
- Add responsive design / mobile-friendly layout
- Add custom themes / styling variations (dark mode, color schemes)
- Integrate into larger projects or real websites

Feel free to fork, customize, and use this design as your own — or extend it to build a fully functional datepicker component. 👍
